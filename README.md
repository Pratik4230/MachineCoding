## Projects

### Accordion UI

An accordion-style UI to display questions and answers, supporting both single and multi-selection modes.

### Features:
- **Single Selection Mode:** Only one accordion item can be expanded at a time.
- **Multi-Selection Mode:** Multiple accordion items can be expanded simultaneously.
- **Smooth Transitions:** CSS transitions for expanding and collapsing items.

### Random Color Generator

Continuing the machine coding round series, the Random Color Generator is a fun and practical project that demonstrates the use of React and Tailwind CSS to create a dynamic color generator.

### Features:
- **Toggle between HEX and RGB:** Choose your preferred color format with a click.
- **Generate Random Colors:** Instantly create a random color in the selected format.
- **Dynamic Background Color:** The screen background changes to the generated color, providing immediate visual feedback.


### Star Rating Component

The Star Rating component adds a sleek and interactive rating system to your projects.

#### Features:
- **Interactive UI:** Enhances user experience with smooth hover and click effects.
- **Responsive Design:** Tailwind CSS ensures the component looks great on any device.
- **Accessibility:** Built with ARIA roles and labels for better accessibility.

### Custom Hook: useWindowResize

The latest addition to our projects, `useWindowResize`, is a custom React hook that tracks window size changes in real-time. This hook ensures your components remain responsive by updating dynamically with the window dimensions.

#### Key Features:
- **Real-time Window Size Tracking:** Keeps your UI up-to-date with current window dimensions.
- **Effortless Integration:** Simple to use in any React component.
- **Optimized Performance:** Utilizes `useLayoutEffect` for smooth updates.



### ClickOutside Component

The `ClickOutside` component is designed to handle outside clicks using React hooks. This is particularly useful for closing modals, dropdowns, or any UI component when a user clicks outside of it.

#### Features:
- **Custom Hook: useOutsideClick:** A reusable hook that detects clicks outside a specified element.
- **State Management:** Manages the visibility of content based on user interactions outside the component.
- **User Experience:** Enhances UI by efficiently managing component state and improving usability.


### Image Slider

Introducing our newest project: the Image Slider! This project utilizes React and Tailwind CSS to create a dynamic and interactive image slider. Stay tuned as we expand its capabilities with features like smooth transitions and navigation controls.

#### Planned Features:
- **Dynamic Image Fetching:** Fetch images from an external API.
- **Smooth Transitions:** Implement CSS transitions for a seamless sliding effect.
- **Navigation Controls:** Prev/Next buttons for easy navigation through images.
